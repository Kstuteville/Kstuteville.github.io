 <p>
 I am a very ambitious and hardworking fourth year student at Colorado College. I am currently working towards a double BA in Computer Science and Art! 
   My ultimate goal is to go into Game Design and create memorable videogames through the art of storytelling. I have gained my experience
   within Computer Science through immersing myself within the Block Plan at Colorado College where I complete projects in 4 week sprints.
   I also am learning all that I can through online courses specifically within the Video Game realm. 
  Outside of Computer Science, I am varisty Volleyball Player at Colorado College. I also spend time on the equestrian team and esports team here on campus.
