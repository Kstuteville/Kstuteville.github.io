<h2>Colorado College Online Marketplace </h2>
<p> The Link to this project is below!
	Colorado College Online Thrift Store is a platform focused on the apparel market. The platform allows students to list and purchase clothing items within the community. 
	The product would target a market and provide features similar to Facebook Marketplace. 
	The platform enables students to save products and follow users they enjoy in order to access them with ease. The platform enables students to contact sellers listing items in order to make transactions outside
	of the program. 
	This project was done in Java! The time we had to complete this task was 3.5 weeks. Within these 3.5 weeks we came up with
	an organized plan with our goals, what features we needed, and a test phase where we tested our product and changed features based on users feedback.

Program Explanation: The Colorado College Online Thrift Store is a specialized platform dedicated to the apparel market. Its primary function is to enable students to both list and purchase clothing items within the community. Within the updated version, users are able to browse through the homepage, customize their profile, and create and delete products of their own, uploading photos. In this newer version, the code reads directly from a database and writes to it. The Colorado College Online Thrift Store employs a graphical user interface to streamline the collection of user signup information and profile data, enhancing personalization and overall navigation within the platform.

Installation and Launch Procedure for Second Hand Code's Project:
Ensure the presence of the following External Libraries:
JUnit 4
Junit 5
MySQL
Upon completing the library setup, initiate the code through the Intellij IDE.
Make sure you have mysql databases loaded up into project structure in modules.
To set up Database Tables:
First Run insert_products class class once and then run ProfilesDBCreator class once to get the tables used for our project on your mysql database.

Navigate to the class named "LoginDisplayUI" and execute "Run Current File," or access the "LoginDisplayUI" class within a Java compiler and execute it. The "LoginDisplayUI" method requires no arguments.
Upon execution, users will be prompted to sign up and subsequently log in. Upon successful authentication, users will be directed to the store's homepage. Following this please feel free to navigate to the profile page and edit or add products. Changes from editing products and creating profiles will remain present even after exiting the program.
If you wish to view a profile that already has listed products please use the username: janedoe and password: P@ssw0rd
